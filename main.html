            <h2>A very brief background about myself and my family</h2>
            <p>I am a stay at home wife and mother of three children living on earth and one in Heaven.  Since getting married to my husband three years ago in February 2022, we had our oldest in November 2022, our second in November 2023, and our third in September 2024.  My days are quite full and demanding, but it is my greatest joy to be a wife and mother.  I received a positive pregnancy test on 12/7/24, but things did unknowingly take a turn and I was diagnosed with a missed or silent miscarriage at an ultrasound that didn’t pick up any cardiac activity.</p>
            <p>My husband and I love the Latin Mass and we are thankful to have a Priestly Fraternity of St Peter parish in our area (FSSP), which is in communion with Rome.  We are especially thankful for the resources provided by one of the priests from our parish as far as what could be done in our situation.   My story is shared through an authentically Catholic lens and I wanted to intertwine my miscarriage story with the sanctity of life and the meaning of being open to life in a society that very much is not.  I have included various resources and articles pertaining to miscarriage and Catholicism that I came across and will also include them in the tabs listed at the top of this site.</p>
        
            <h2>Beatriz Maria Elfering</h2>
            <p>For reasons only known by God, our fourth child was called home early to Heaven after I was diagnosed with a silent miscarriage at an ultrasound that didn’t pick up any cardiac activity.   In order to remember her, we had a private Mass of the Angels followed by the rosary and burial at St Mary’s Catholic Cemetery in Norfolk.  We also enrolled her at The Shrine of the Unborn located at The Church of The Holy Innocents in NYC.  Her name will be written in the book of life there, and every Monday a Mass is prayed for those enrolled and for their families.  We were unable to do a conditional baptism for her since it was definitively determined that she passed away before I had labored her, but there is such thing as a baptism of desire- and we truly did desire to have her baptized.</p>
            
            <h2>Consolation from a Dream</h2>
            <p>The determination of her name was impacted by a dream that I had and that I also feel provided me consolation that she is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>On the morning of January 21 the day of my ultrasound to confirm whether the pregnancy was viable or not, I had a dream that Drew and I were seated in some lobby waiting area.  In the dream, I saw a sleeping baby in a baby carrier within eye sight of us by our seats. I noticed a reflective gold name tag that was placed on the middle of their chest and I couldn’t read it from where I was sitting, so I walked up to the baby and knelt down to try to read it.  I read the name “Beatriz,” which is the Spanish or Portuguese spelling. I had never thought of this name before and I couldn’t fully identify for sure who the baby was in the dream as I didn’t examine the baby more closely.  I was intrigued more by the name tag in the dream and that it was gold, a color that symbolizes everlasting life in the Catholic Church and is used to adorn angels and saints.  The dream abruptly ended not longer after that.  Later that day, I researched to see if a St Beatriz exists.  I found a St Beatriz of Silva from Portugal who was the foundress of the monastic order of the Immaculate Conception that was established in Toledo, Spain.  She had a devotion to the Immaculate Conception 400 years before it was officially made dogma.  In some pictures of her, you will see a gold star in the middle of her forehead.  She lived most of her life veiling her face as many men thought she was beautiful and wanted to court her; however, as she was dying to receive anointing of the sick, she had to uncover her face and it is said that a star reflected on her forehead. The star remained there until she breathed her last breath.  What I thought was also interesting was that she passed August 16, 1491 and her feast is celebrated on August 17 or September 1 by the Franciscans.  August 17 is tentatively what the due date of our fourth child could have been.  Also, I read that Pope Paul VI declared her heroic virtues on January 21, 1974 which is the is same day that I had my ultrasound to confirm if the pregnancy was viable and found out that it wasn’t.  Not all dreams should be overanalyzed, but the dream stood out to me and I don’t think it was merely coincidence.  Because of this my husband and I felt prompted to use Beatriz as a name as I do feel pretty strongly that it was a girl.</p>
        
            <h2>Coping with Grief and Suffering</h2>
            <p>Going through this loss has caused a lot of grief, but I also feel deeply loved by God to have this heavy cross to carry.  It is our sufferings in this life, whether big or small,  that help us to unite ourselves with Jesus Christ through his suffering and sacrifice on the cross.  Most venerable Fulton Sheen is someone who understands and speaks of this very well: “Every tear, disappointment, and grieved heart is a blank check.  If we write our name on it, it is worthless.  If we sign it with Christ’s name, it is infinite in its value. In prosperity, Christ gives you his gifts; in suffering with faith, Christ gives you himself.”  We can pray and hope for a good pregnancy outcome, in fact, it is good to pray for this, but prayer is not meant to be treated like a genie. It is not just asking, but it is putting oneself in the hands of God and at His disposition.  For some reason, I do feel that God was calling my husband and I into this loss to experience and this was God’s will for our child.  God’s will will not always spare us of suffering and grief, but it is this suffering that does have a purpose and it is where Jesus truly can become closer to us.  Despite the grief that my husband and I have felt, we are at peace because we trust that our child is in Heaven.     She will always be our fourth and she is certainly irreplaceable.  We are all irreplaceable and we were made to never die and to have eternal life.</p>
            <p>The news really did catch me off guard initially, as I didn’t have any symptoms going into the appointment that indicated I miscarried, and I was still having pregnancy symptoms on and off.  It is estimated that 1-5% of pregnancies end in silent miscarriage; however, miscarriage is a reality for a lot of women and I am thankful for those at my parish who have been able to relate, share their stories, and offer prayers.</p>
            <p>While the baby was only estimated at 6 weeks and a day, as Catholics, we value human life at every stage. Truly this was not just a clump of cells.  Life starts from conception and this was our child with a soul planted by God.  By February 1,  I labored the baby and majority of the tissue at home naturally, but there was a substantial amount of tissue my body had made for a baby that was just six weeks.  It was pretty clear to me that my body was working hard for a short period of time to try to sustain a life growing inside of me, even though the baby was really tiny. We were interested in having genetic testing done to see if they could pinpoint what was wrong and definitively determine gender, but due to inconsistent information from the practice I went to as far as if and how it could be done, we were unable to attain genetic testing.  I did not lose my peace over this thankfully, and as I have already stated, I am grateful enough for the dream I had that provided some consolation.</p>
